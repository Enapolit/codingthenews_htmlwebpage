    <h1>Anti-Asian Hate Crimes on the Rise in New York City</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>Increase in anti-Asian hate crimes drives doubling in hate crime complaints from last year</p>
	   <p>By Elizabeth Napolitano</p>
	   
	   <p>Anti-Asian hate crimes have surged 361% from last year, according to <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/hate-crimes.page">data</a> shared by the NYPD Hate Crimes Panel at a press conference in Brooklyn last Thursday. 

</p> 
	<p>The rise in anti-Asian crime has driven a 106% increase in hate crimes across all bias categories citywide. </p>
	   <p> Authorities attribute the rise in crime against Asian and Asian-American communities to the coronavirus pandemic, which is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China. NYPD data shows that hate crime complaints generally rose most sharply in police precincts overseeing neighborhoods with significant Asian populations like Flushing (69% Asian), Two Bridges (65% Asian), Chinatown (64% Asian), and Midtown Manhattan (17% Asian).   
</p>
	   <p> Anti-Asian crime jumped from 28 incidents in 2020 to 129 incidents in 2021.</p>
<p>Tommy Ng, commanding officer of the NYPD's Asian Hate Crimes Task Force, says the increase in AAPI hate crime complaints can be attributed to two things.  
</p>  
<p>"We've always experienced violence for those of us who live in urban areas, and so that's been consistent,” Ng said. “And then there's also last year's trend of pandemic racism."
 
</p>  
	   <p>Manjusha Kulkarni, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition aimed at addressing anti-Asian discrimination, says her organization has been tracking the disproportionate uptick in anti-Asian crime nationwide and has noticed an especially large increase in attacks in Asian-majority neighborhoods, even when aggressions aren’t clearly labeled as anti-AAPI attacks.</p>
	   <p> “There has been a huge increase in what police are calling ‘anti-covid’ attacks, but the data clearly shows that it’s Asian Americans who are the victims of these crimes,” said Kulkarni. “Many times of these attacks are occuring in Asian-majority neighborhoods. Hate incidents that we have been tracking since March 2020 are not going away.” </p>
	   <p>While anti-Asian crimes aren’t always recorded as anti-Asian crimes, it is clear that hate crime incidents are heavily concentrated in heavily-Asian neighborhoods. </p>

	<p> Half of the top six police precinct regions with the most hate crimes per capita in 2021 had Asian-majority populations, despite the fact that only a handful of the NYPD's 77 precincts oversee neighborhoods with large Asian and Asian-American populations. None of those neighborhoods, however, topped the list of hate crime complaints in 2019, before the pandemic.  Hate crime complaints per capita have also increased 600% in Flushing, Queens, with 0.4 hate crime complaints per 100,000 people recorded in 2019, versus 2.8 complaints per 100,000 people in 2021.
